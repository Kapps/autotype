# Flow / TypeScript Auto-Type
Placeholder for future plans for automatically adding flowtypes / TypeScript declarations by using runtime introspection. Not remotely ready for even testing; nothing even exists yet. The idea would be a Babel plugin that adds calls on each method to log the parameters passed in, and then collect these types and update the function parameters / objects / etc to use the types.
